# fake-news-detector
This project was made for the Responsible AI Student Organization (RAISO) and their Workshop series during the Spring 2025 quarter at Northwestern University. Using NLP techniques, we took a publicly available dataset and trained a classifier to predict whether or not it was fake news.

The following Jupyter Notebook was prodced by RAISO's Workshop Committee during the Spring quarter of the 2024-2025 Academic Year at Northwestern University. The model is trained using the following steps:
1. Preprocess the dataset from the following Kaggle page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=True.csv
2. Tokenize the data into words, and extract information using the TF-IDF method
3. Train the model using logistic regression
